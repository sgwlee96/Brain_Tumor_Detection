# Brain Tumor Detection with Xception Deep Learning Model


## Overview



## Approach

In this project, I utilized the Xception deep learning model, which is renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The Xception model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that excels at feature extraction from images, making it well-suited for medical image analysis tasks. 

This is the example image of the structure of Xception model

## Dataset

The dataset is used from various sources in kaggle. 
The dataset contains 155 images for positive brain tumor images and 98 images for negative brain tumor images. The images are randomly chosen from various sources and I intentionally did not use sufficient number of images because in real world, it is hard to get enough datasets of patients in health care field. 

The below images are random samples of positive and negative brain tumor images used for training.
