Brain Tumor Detection with Xception Deep Learning Model
This project aims to detect brain tumors using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Xception architecture. Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical imaging analysis, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment planning for patients.

Overview
Brain tumors can pose significant health risks and early detection plays a crucial role in ensuring timely intervention and treatment. Deep learning models, with their ability to learn complex patterns from medical images, offer promising solutions for automating the detection process.

Approach
In this project, we utilize the Xception deep learning model, which is renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The Xception model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that excels at feature extraction from images, making it well-suited for medical image analysis tasks.

Dataset
We utilize a dataset consisting of brain MRI images, annotated with labels indicating the presence or absence of tumors. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the performance of the Xception model in tumor detection.

Implementation
Our implementation involves training the Xception model on the provided dataset to learn the intricate patterns associated with brain tumors. We employ techniques such as data augmentation, regularization, and optimization to enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

Results
After training the Xception model, we evaluate its performance on a separate validation dataset to assess its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in tumor detection. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in accurately identifying brain tumors from MRI images.

Usage
To utilize the trained model for brain tumor detection, users can either employ the provided pre-trained model or retrain the model on their own dataset for specific requirements.
