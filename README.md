# Brain Tumor Detection with Xception Deep Learning Model

This project aims to detect brain tumors using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Xception architecture. Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical imaging analysis, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment planning for patients.

## Overview

Brain tumors can pose significant health risks and early detection plays a crucial role in ensuring timely intervention and treatment. Deep learning models, with their ability to learn complex patterns from medical images, offer promising solutions for automating the detection process.

## Approach

In this project, I utilized the Xception deep learning model, which is renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The Xception model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that excels at feature extraction from images, making it well-suited for medical image analysis tasks.
